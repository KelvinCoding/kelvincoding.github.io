I've been working on several side projects for the past few months, some even longer, but with more intention to complete them since November. However, I've been pushing each one's deadline farther and farther, making sure that I don't actually complete one of these projects.

I, irrationally, became afraid of finishing projects. Being burned several times at school, work, and normal life by "finishing" a project only to figure out later on that it either wasn't enough or not even close to what people wanted from me. My insight into those things has either dwindled or wasn't there in the first place and I managed to get through those things by bullshitting. I started valuing other people's perspective on the work I was doing, while good for the most part, I began to take it too seriously and let the negative criticism affect me more than I should have. But now, after all the mishaps with work, I can't help but accept that kind of negativity. It's eaten me everyday, making me think too much on each decision, paralyzing me in so many ways. Somedays I can't work up the willpower to talk to my closest friends because I'm not good enough at being able to express myself in a more socially acceptable manner. Somedays I can't push myself to write up the code that I want to do so I can share it with the rest of the world and let them know how interesting the things I'm working on are. Somedays I can't look at the person I adore in their eyes, because I know that I'm not enough for them.

Every day, at every moment, at every decision, I started questioning myself over and over. Asking myself, "is this the best thing to do?" With never finding an answer to that question, I started to make it easier for myself and expanded on the question.

> Who am I doing this for?
> What do they think about it?

This last one is the most important part. They get to know that you're working on something for them, lets them be appreciative of you and vice versa; they get to give you feedback on what you've been working on so that you're not going off of assumptions, usually wrong ones too; they get to give you perspective on things that you didn't think of before that may enhance the project. Ultimately, I started to bring people back into the projects that I was working on.

The same thing that made me afraid is what will help me keep moving forward.
