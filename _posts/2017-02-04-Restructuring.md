These past few weeks I've been struggling to figure out the next steps in my life. Several different companies and entities have offered me some fun new opportunities to expand my knowledge past the current state of technology, business, socioeconomics, and life. Most of them I don't really want to take into consideration since none of them actually make me interested in the work I would be doing, but I would be interested in the new fields that I would be learning, only because it's something new and applicable to the position. So I'm struggling to understand why things don't interest me in the way that the initial motivation would be there for me to begin the pursuit for the knowledge I'm lacking.

I've been reading _Godel Escher Bach_ during this time as it was recommended by a coworker that I regard highly in both a mental peer and a social peer. He was interested in my thoughts on Godel's theorems and how they relate to my everyday actions. He was surprised that I didn't know of Godel's theorems or at least know them in detail to have a meaningful conversation.

Researching thoroughly, _Godel's Incompleteness Theorem_ has shaken the foundation of my life and how I interpret the world around me. I thought the logic of mathematics, and therefore sciences, were strictly consistent and infallible. While Godel's Theorem doesn't state otherwise, it states this:

> 1. Any _consistent_ formal system within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried is _incomplete_.
> 2. Assuming that our formal system is _consistent_ then the formal system cannot prove its own consistency

In summary, any formal system can only be either _consistent_ or _incomplete_. For clarity and conciseness:

> _Completeness_ means that a true statement can be proved to be true within the formal system

> _Consistency_ means that a statement can only be proved to be true or false and not both within the formal system

This simple theorem, which I won't prove here, has and is currently restructuring each and every cornerstone of my life. The meaning of this is that anything that we can know, and will know is going to be incomplete. I somewhat understood this since the strive for perfection is not about being perfect, but knowing the areas that we're lacking in and becoming better in it. Due to Godel's theorem we can't know that what we're doing is truly good/bad/etc since we can't prove that we're consistent within our formal system.

So I will never know if what I'm doing is going to be good, bad, right, wrong. The unknowns in my life are perfectly fine for being unknown, but it doesn't mean that I can't come to an small understanding of those unknowns. From the completely  structured life that I've created for myself, to the unfathomable realms of science, mathematics, religion, sociology, etc. I have to have faith that what I base my ideas off of may be entirely wrong in the end.

But that journey, incorporating people I love and care about deeply, is well worth being _incomplete_ and (hopefully) _consistent_.
