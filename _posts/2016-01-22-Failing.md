I have failed many times this month. From forgetting to post my weekly blog (on week 2) and somehow destroying my site to missing important deadline for work. There has been many things I have tried to prevent, or at the very least, lessen the amount of times I fail. Yes, we are only human; yes, we will fail since we are not perfect; but that should not be an excuse for the failures to happen time and time again.

To me, failing is one of the worst things that could happen. Failing wastes the time you invested into the project for virtually no end result. Learning from the failures is the most important part of failing. First, you should *rarely* do what you have just done to accomplish the same goal, since we have just learned that it was ineffective. Secondly, instead of focusing on what not to do, we should focus on the things that worked out well in this attempt. How did you go about accomplishing the goal? What were you doing during those bursts of motivation and efficacy? Lastly, we need to incorporate what we have done correctly into the next iteration of our attempt. The best and worst part about this, we will probably fail again.

Failing is by far one of the most important things in life. From the humbling feeling it gives, to not know everything; to generating a wealth of knowledge about yourself.
