This is Part 3 and 4 of going through some idealistic modern virtues within my life.

I missed a few months on writing about those virtues because of other issues at hand. Now we're back, with some new insights.

Almost a month ago I nearly gave up on myself. Everything I worked on started to crack and break; the people I loved and cared for I couldn't stand to be around; all the little improvements I made to myself weren't helping. I felt as if I failed in every aspect of my life. And there was a deep feeling of helplessness and hopelessness; that I couldn't and didn't know how to fix it.

People call it several different things, be it an existential crisis, burnout, or depression, it affected how I worked through things day to day.

This problem was difficult to identify. It's a cunning one, that fed off of my passion, my energy, enthusiasm. So many positive emotions, qualities, traits, and turning them into a spiral of frustration, exhaustion, and inevitably self-doubt. This wasn't as simple as having a bad day, being tired and worn out; it is being out of sync with all or parts of our life. The balance between work, life, and enthusiam of would allow us to feel engaged and valued with those people we care for and the work that we're doing. Sometimes we lose that balance we start to tumble for a little bit, and we get back up. Once that balance is lost for too long, it becomes too difficult to rise again.

I tried to breakdown my own, personal, problem to several aspects that I'm now working towards fixing.

- [Unfairness](#unfairness)
- [Work Overload](#work-overload)
- [Lack of Control](#lack-of-control)
- [Conflicting Values](#conflicting-values)
- [Insufficient Rewards](#insufficient-rewards)
- [Breakdown of Community](#breakdown-of-community)

## Unfairness

Unfairness is hard to understand and ultimately accept, especially when it was in no fault of your own. Unfairness is cruel, yet true to its nature; unfairness is paradoxically fair. It does not care for who you are, what you've done; it doesn't matter if you're the most altruistic person or the cruelest human, it does and will get to you.

I lost myself to understanding why the outcome of my previous position happened. My team and I designed a system that was a better system than the original, that we would have been able to implement in a shorter time-span, that was theoretically easier to maintain by others. To my understanding of any systems, both new and old, this was wholly positive. A quicker and better turn-around time meant that we could work on the next cool project that we would all want; reduce cost for the people and companies involved; be able to test a nascent system and fix any problems well within the original time frame. And yet I lost. The company told me that implementing that plan of action was inherently insubordination as I, the lead on the project (or at least on paper), had no say on the design and planning. That those involved had the final say on the strategic plan. That my "agenda-pushing" plan was trying to take too much control from them.

I didn't understand any of it. I still don't, but that's the entirety of unfairness. We don't have to understand why. We just have to accept that those things do happen, and readjust our plan accordingly.

## Work Overload

This one is more of a self-imposed problem, and is ultimately my biggest flaw. I forgot the most important part of being a lead; __I have people behind me at every step__. At the beginning of the project I had a great cadence with my team in terms of keeping up with them; leveraging their strengths to offset mine and others; working through design meetings and obtaining various perspectives. As the time went on, the stress building up, I was afraid of failing the project in every aspect. I started to take more control away from my team, segregating them from each other and started silo-ing them into their own little domain.

This overloaded my abilities and I became out-of-sync with my team. I tried to manage how each silo needed to work. I took over the design aspect so I had complete control on how the systems were being implemented. I took over how the sprints were planned, managed, conducted, and tracked. I saw every deficient portion of my team and tried to fix it.

I forgot the most important aspect of being a leader. That my skills an abilities will never be enough to manage something more than me. Through a lot of deliberation and correspondence with my team, I started to let go of the superficial control that I had. It didn't help the team that I basically took over their jobs, that I basically made them think less for themselves. This took a long time to undo the damage that I had done, but eventually my team trusted me again, though not as they used to.

## Lack of Control

Control is something we all want. I tried to take control of the problem. Unfortunately, it was superficial. Taking charge on every aspect of the team made me feel like I was in control, but that didn't control the problem but raised other ones. I was trying to control the problem by controlling the solution. It might have been a good idea at the start, but when the solution involves other people you start to manipulate others to become inline with your view on the solution rather than taking everyone else's and come up with new ways to control the problem. Each one of my team members were one of the best I've had in their respective expertise. But I confined them to my vision, one which might have been flawed in the first place.

I learned that there's only so much that I can control, all with respect to my influence. Most of the problems given to me aren't mine to _control_, but are problems to be concerned and try to find others to help control that problem with other creative solutions that I wouldn't be able to come up with. The problems that I can actually manage inevitably have a simpler answer than the whirlwind of "solutions" that I try to find.

## Conflicting Values

Everyone values things differently, but this tackles the core values that everyone had with respect to those above us. We were a team similar to Lockhead Martin's Skunk Works group. One in the background experimenting, implementing, decimating every project thrown at us. We knew how to dissect those projects into effective chunks that we could tackle, determine potential solutions, experiment with each one. If solutions didn't pan out, which often happened, we went back to the drawing board. After enough times, we would put the project in our "Future" bucket. When solutions worked, we pressed forward with two parts, making the process more efficient and finding another solution. Each of those these styles of execution wore down on those above us. While we were effictive and worked relatively quickly (we were usually finished a week within our target deadlines on those we completed), the strain on finances from the "failed" projects and trying to find other solutions rather than pressing forward allowed people directing us to have leverage against us.

The last project I worked on was especially difficult on us. Our directors tasked us with a very long term project, the entire team estimated at least a year to complete the first prototype. We deliberated and tried to get a grasp on the scope of the project, from edge cases that we could think of right then to potential other use cases that weren't in the initial draft that was given to us. Completing a first version with this team would have taken us at minimum 4 years with an MVP sometime during the 3rd year. They tasked us to finish it within 2 years. I was a bit shocked as deadlines were usually negotiated in very reasonable manners with both the team and the directors understanding the level of effort on these projects were. But because they wanted something done quickly, they wanted to bypass the way we work. They wanted to skip over how we conquered our tasks and optimized our solutions. Granted there were times when we went overboard and spent a few extra weeks on a solution that didn't _need_ optimizing; or spending a few extra months trying to come up with a new solution since we couldn't succeed with our previous one.

We were losing a battle. Morale started to wane. People became stressed on how daunting it is to finish a project in half our original estimate. Directors wanted to have their cake and eat it, and eat it quickly. We wanted to make sure the cake was going to at least be edible, but things started to fall through.

## Insufficient Rewards

We lost sight of the reasons on why we were working on these projects. We wanted to relax at the end of every day, go to a bar and grab some drinks and share ridiculous stories. We didn't know what we were getting out of the project, aside from completion. Once milestones were set, we didn't have time to celebrate. It was time to work again. It was hard to see my team lose motivation because they didn't have some sort of reward for accomplishing their goals, but we needed to complete our project in a limited time. And that was the wrong mentality.

We used to have fun finding solutions for each of our projects because we celebrated the rare times a solution was found to work, but now... Now we created hack-ish ways to solve the problem, ways that each one of us looked at and asked ourselves, "Really? This is what we came up with?" We started taking short-cuts so we started losing our edge. We started to lose our internal rewards within the team, showing our prowess with one another and expanding each other's abilities by constructive, candid, criticism. Now it's disappointment, "I can't believe we had to make that"

We didn't want external rewards aside from having time outside of work to relax and not think about work. Now our internal rewards were taken and we started losing each other.

## Breakdown of Community

Once we started disappointing each other, our spirals kept going faster and faster. We started to think negatively about each other, that not just everyone else was incompetent, but each person actually thought that they were incompetent. People didn't hate each other, we just had different, worse, thoughts about each other from before. I didn't expect all of them to be geniuses in every category, but I acted like it.

Solving each of these problems took a long time. The last couple of months I brought this to attention within the team and we started to relax about the project. Maybe a little too much. We went back to our original methods, but the damage was already done to team. We didn't work as effectively as we used to, but our morale was a lot better, more manageable, and most importantly we wanted to help each other improve once again.

Unfortunately, I had to take the hit for the team. Due to the detrimental effects that this project came with, through mostly my lack of effective leadership. We were a few months behind schedule and I had to reset expectations with our directors. Irritated as they should be, I was asked to step down and let someone else manage the team. I asked they either be vetted by the entire team or be someone within the team and hire others to backfill their positions. They agreed and I worked on vetting the team to figure out who was capable of managing all of them, better than I could.

There wasn't an easy answer, each one of us had deficiencies that the others covered. I wouldn't be leading that team if it wasn't for each of them keeping me in check and expanding my insights. We asked the team to see who they thought would be capable. Their answers surprised me in a good way. Many of them didn't choose one person, but a team to manage the team itself. Not something so structured as a Project Manager, Lead Developer, etc. but something closer to leaders each complementing each others strengths and weaknesses. In the end, we chose 3 others to take my position and let them run the team better than I can. I let them run the team during my last week. They were phenomenal. They already learned from my mistakes, and took reigns in mitigating deficiencies within the team, regardless of the problems within the project. Even within the projects, they were brilliant at conducting the design meetings and ways to tackle the problem. I always envisioned a more socratic system, but not everyone was able to attend due to conflicts, but they made it entirely optional so that only those who wanted to be there and have an opinion on the solutions were able to bring it up without any issues.
