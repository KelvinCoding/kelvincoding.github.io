It has been an eventful 2015. I changed jobs from an adventurous researcher to a more rewarding software developer. I moved from my home to a place farther from it, yet enough to make me venture out. I traveled with friends to some big urban areas; on my own to some beautiful and serene landscapes. Yet it all escapes me when asked about the details. It was and is not the events themselves that causes this, but my current perspective in life.

Being depressed is the primary factor on *why* my perspective is like this. I will not be writing about how difficult it is to live a life with depression. To me that part is simple. You just do.

I took up a position at a financial company, as a back-end developer, later moved into the data analytics and research side of it. Learning there was exciting. Absorbing the knowledge by going to meetings with the primary traders and lead developers was short of magical. I became jaded as time went, the flow of the knowledge dwindled, the enthusiasm of a child with a new toy faded. As I grew more aware of the state I was in, I began to look for different avenues to fuel the fire. While researching how the rest of the world tackled the issues a financial company faced, the flood gates opened once again, pouring in knowledge from every deep corner of the field. Fortunately that never stopped, the amount of knowledge the world had in each field was vast in its own accord and having the access to it all was entertaining. Yet it grew daunting. I started asking what the point in learning it all when everyone before me failed to do what they aimed to do; to make enough money to not worry about it. Mashing different theories together one moment, dissecting a different theory the next, and mashing them again wasn't working in simulations. The never-ending failures etched itself into me.

This didn't mean I stopped trying to find solutions to the problem, it meant that I started to forget my accomplishments. I was unable to see the progress I was making anymore. I'm changing that now.

This place is going to serve that purpose. Of the good and bad of my life; of the goals achieved and the goals missed; of what I gained and lost through these endeavors. I am happy for every event that happened in 2015. Now I will make every event happy in 2016.
