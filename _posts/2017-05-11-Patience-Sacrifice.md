I missed several weeks of writing these virtuous topics because of these topics at hand. Now we're back, with some new insights.

Almost a month ago I nearly gave up on myself. Everything I worked on started to crack and break; the people I loved and cared for I couldn't stand to be around; all the little improvements I made to myself weren't helping. I felt as if I failed in every aspect of my life. And there was a deep feeling of helplessness and hopelessness; that I couldn't and didn't know how to fix it.

People call it several different things, be it an existential crisis or depression, it affected how I worked through things day to day.

This problem was difficult to identify. It's a cunning one, that fed off of my passion, my energy, enthusiasm. So many positive emotions, qualities, traits, and turning them into a spiral of frustration, exhaustion, and inevitably self-doubt. This wasn't as simple as having a bad day, being tired and worn out; it is being out of sync with all or parts of our life. The balance between work, life, and enthusiam of would allow us to feel engaged and valued with those people we care for and the work that we're doing. Sometimes we lose that balance we start to tumble for a little bit, and we get back up. Once that balance is lost for too long, it becomes too difficult to rise again.

I tried to breakdown my own, personal, problem to several aspects that I'm now working towards fixing.

- [Unfairness](#unfairness)
- [Work Overload](#work-overload)
- [Lack of Control](#lack-of-control)
- [Conflicting Values](#conflicting-values)
- [Insufficient Rewards](#insufficient-rewards)
- [Breakdown of Community](#breakdown-of-community)

## Unfairness

Unfairness is hard to understand and ultimately accept, especially when it was in no fault of your own. Unfairness is cruel, yet true to its nature; unfairness is paradoxically fair. It does not care for who you are, what you've done; it doesn't matter if you're the most altruistic person or the cruelest human, it does and will get to you.

I lost myself to understanding why the outcome of my previous position happened. My team and I designed a system that was a better system than the original, that we would have been able to implement in a shorter time-span, that was theoretically easier to maintain by others. To my understanding of any systems, both new and old, this was wholly positive. A quicker and better turn-around time meant that we could work on the next cool project that we would all want; reduce cost for the people and companies involved; be able to test a nascent system and fix any problems well within the original time frame. And yet I lost. The company told me that implementing that plan of action was inherently insubordination as I, the lead on the project (or at least on paper), had no say on the design and planning. That those involved had the final say on the strategic plan. That my "agenda-pushing" plan was trying to take too much control from them.

I didn't understand any of it. I still don't, but that's the entirety of unfairness. We don't have to understand why. We just have to accept that those things do happen, and readjust our plan accordingly.

## Work Overload

This one is more of a self-imposed problem, and is ultimately my biggest flaw. I forgot the most important part of being a lead; __I have people behind me at every step__. At the beginning of the project I had a great cadence with my team in terms of keeping up with them; leveraging their strengths to offset mine and others; working through design meetings and obtaining various perspectives. As the time went on, the stress building up, I was afraid of failing the project in every aspect. I started to take more control away from my team, segregating them from each other and started silo-ing them into their own little domain.

This overloaded my abilities and I became out-of-sync with my team.
